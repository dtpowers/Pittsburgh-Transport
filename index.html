							<h3>Uber</h3>
							<p></b>What it’s best for:</b> Short rides, getting somewhere quickly, travelling with a small group (3-5) of friends, getting a ride late at night. </p>

							<b>What it costs:</b> Uber costs are all about supply and demand. They have a system called Surge Pricing which applies a multiplier to standard fees at their busiest times. You will always see the Surge multiplier and must agree to it before taking an Uber.
